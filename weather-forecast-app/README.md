Usage
Searching for Weather:

Enter a city name into the search bar and press "Enter" or click the search button.
The application fetches weather data for the specified city from the weather API.
While data is loading, a spinner is displayed to indicate that the request is being processed.
If the data is successfully retrieved, the weather information is displayed, including temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.
If an error occurs (e.g., city not found), an error message is displayed.
Navigating Back:

Use the "Back" button to return to the previous page or home.


Example Spinner Integration:

import { Bars } from 'react-loader-spinner';

// Inside your component
if (loading) 
  return (
    <div className="spinner-container">
      <Bars color="#00BFFF" height={80} width={80} />
    </div>
  );


Troubleshooting
Error: Cannot read properties of undefined

This error typically occurs when trying to access properties of an undefined object. Ensure that the data fetched from the API is correctly handled and that appropriate checks are in place to handle undefined values.
Spinner Not Showing

Ensure that the spinner component is imported correctly and the CSS class spinner-container is applied to the element containing the spinner.
For any other issues, check the browser console for errors and ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
